# Coin Collector Game

Coin Collector is a terminal-based game where the player collects coins to progress through levels while avoiding the hidden bomb coin. If the player collects the bomb coin and itâ€™s the last coin, the level progresses; otherwise, the game ends.

## Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Levels increase in difficulty as more coins are added.
- **Bomb Coin Challenge**: One coin is secretly a bomb. Collecting it prematurely ends the game!
- **Intuitive Controls**: Move the player character (`@`) using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
- **Game Over Handling**: Displays a final score and exit prompt upon losing.
- **Level Progression**: Successfully collecting all coins, including the bomb as the last coin, advances to the next level.
